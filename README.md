# deep-learning-challenge

### Summary
We are using machine learning for nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
In the data frame we can see some information and predict how applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We used customer provide "charity_data.csv" dataset and use "APPLICATION_TYPE" to start predict in machine learning.
Also we use ['CLASSIFICATION'].value_counts() to support counts in the data frame and using "sklearn.model_selection and sklearn.preprocessing" to support nonprofit foundation predict.

### Result
In the model_loss result is Loss: 0.5615853071212769, Accuracy: 0.731195330619812.
