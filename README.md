# deep-learning-challenge

### Summary
We are using machine learning for nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
In the data frame we can see some information and predict how applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We used customer provide "charity_data.csv" dataset and use "APPLICATION_TYPE" to start predict in machine learning.
Also we use ['CLASSIFICATION'].value_counts() to support counts in the data frame and using "sklearn.model_selection and sklearn.preprocessing" to support nonprofit foundation predict.

### Result
Total params: 5,981 Trainable params: 5,981 Non-trainable params: 0.    
In Result, the model achieved a loss of 0.5616 and an accuracy of 0.7312 on the test data. 
This means that the model performed reasonably well in predicting the target variable for the unseen test samples, with an accuracy of 73.12%. The selecting applicants for funding may not easy success, 
because 73.12% is not a high rate.  
If Alphabet Soup has a more lenient approach and is willing to accept a certain level of risk or wants to cast a wider net to support a larger number of potential successful ventures, 
a 73.12% accuracy could be considered reasonable.
